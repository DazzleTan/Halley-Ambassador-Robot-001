In this folder there are printable templates for cutting on cardboard.
This will be very useful if you want to build this robot 
but do not have access to a laser cutter.

There are five printable PDF documents, labeled as follows:
-White
-Black
-Clear
-Foot
-Head

Special Thanks to Amby Ambroise from France for 
converting my laser-cuttable DXF templates to printable PDF documents!
